**Question 1:** ImageDataGenerator() is a method that creates subdirectories (in our case, within training and testing directories). Subdirectories are like folders within our directories that auto-label data points with class names specific to the subdirectoy. For example, if our validation data directory contained images of horses and humans, the subdirectories would be one horse and one human subdirectory containing the associated images. Within the ImageDataGenerator method, we can use an argument called rescale to normalize the data. The input for this argument looks like **resale = 1/#** where # is the max value found in the datapoints (the range). By normalizing the data, all values fall between 0 and 1.
