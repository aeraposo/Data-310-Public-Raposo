## 7.29.20 Class Exercise:
**Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier:**
- Natural language processing (NLP) describes the process of training a model that can interpret human speech. Some of the capabilities of NLP include language translation, text generation, and more. This week, we built an RNN that can detect sarcasm in news headlines. We achieved this by tokenizing words in a dataset of news headlines labeled either sarcastic (1) or not sarcastic (0) to turn sentences into sequences of numbers, padded these sequences with zeros to make them all the same length, and built an RNN (uses an embedding layer). After fitting the model, I gave it a spin on the following examples
[1.3710256e-08] = ~0 - "The child-care industry is on the brink of collapse. Congress must rescue it."
[2.8298592e-07] = ~0 - "Protests live updates: NYPD facing questions as demonstrations continue"
[3.2580751e-01] = ~0 - "US announces plans to remove 12,000 troops from Germany, with half coming home"
[7.1725477e-03] = ~0 - "Justice Department to expand federal law enforcement presence in Midwestern cities"
[5.6891394e-09] = ~0 - "These Microbes May Have Survived 100 Million Years Beneath the Seafloor"
[1.5391873e-07] = ~0 - "Trump’s Summer of Love Is a Distant Memory Now"
[9.9453628e-01] = ~1 - "Michael Goodwin: Barr eats Nadler's lunch during testimony"
[1.6046785e-07] = ~0 - "A Republican Panic Button"
[8.8728958e-01] = ~1 - "Why You’ll See Two Figures for G.D.P. Decline: Very Big, and Huge"
[2.1694852e-05] = ~0 - "Joe Biden takes a non-virtual moment to muse on his basement, apocalyptic ads and being Trump’s ‘antithesis’"
