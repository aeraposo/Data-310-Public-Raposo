## Project 2: Art!

<br/>
As evident from the above images, my piece went through some dramatic changes as I altered my model settings. I began with images of geometric tessellations, which I attempted to hybridize with images of graphic representations of neural networks and found little success (in simple terms, my art was *very* ugly). After playing around with the saturation, colors, and other elements of my images, I realized that darker images and ones of significatly different sizes, were not very compatable and ajusted accordingly.

<br/> On a more personal note, William and Mary and the Jump Start program are both very important to me, which I sought to convey in my piece. One of the trademarks of the College is the Wren building. At a ripe ~320 years old, the Wren building has weathered it all, give or take a few fires, standing the test of time day after day. Similarly, students of the Jump Start program have powered through the program, standing an analogous test of time. The Wren building not only serves as a symbol of triumph and determination but also as a reminder of the importance of community. Celebrations such as Eule log, Wren 10s, and Convocation all revolve around community and appropiatly take place at Wren. The overwhelming sense of community akrewed though this program, after persisting through the challenges presented by the pandemic and rallying when feeling defeated, are reflected through the symbolism of Wren and its numberous beloved traditions.
